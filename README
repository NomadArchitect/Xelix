To build, you'll need GCC (possibly >= 4.4.3), NASM and GNU make, the GNU Binutils and Python.

1. Run 'tools/makefile.py' which will generate a Makefile (You'll have to re-execute this whenever you add or remove a source file)
2. Run 'make clean && make'
3. Run 'make runqemu' (You need QEMU to do this)

To submit your changes, create a patch using 'git-format-patch', then send it to the mailinglist.

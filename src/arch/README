Architecture dependent code portions
------------------------------------

You might ask yourself how things in here work.

Actually, it's quite simple:
No matter which architecture, we always use the same headers (= the ones in here).
The only thing changing is the code which provides those functions in the headers, aka the stuff in the directories.
